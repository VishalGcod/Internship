        Browsers do not always display the image referenced by the element. This
        is the case for non-graphical browsers (including those used by people
        with visual impairments), if the user chooses not to display images, or
        if the browser cannot display the image because it is invalid or an
        unsupported type. In these cases, the browser may replace the image with
        the text defined in this element's alt attribute. You should, for these
        reasons and others, provide a useful value for alt whenever possible.
